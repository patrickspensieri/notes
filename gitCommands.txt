Example of a efficient, basic workflow used by Codemy:

	Master —> Develop —> featureBranch
	
	New features are developed in isolation, then merged with Develop.
	
	Master ——> Production Server
	Develop ——> Staging Server
	
	This enables Develop to be tested before integration with production
	The client can use this server to review code, give opinion
	Once approved, the Develop branch is merged with the Master
